				 	        “We are really upset, confused and disappointed by Marshmello’s choice to work with Tyga and Chris Brown,” the band tweeted in a statement. “We like and respect Mello as a person but working with people who are predators and abusers enables, excuses and ultimately tacitly endorses that behaviour. That is not something we can or will stand behind.”

                                It may be hard to imagine, but your parents had lives before you were born. They were complex creatures with teen-angst and unrequieted loves and strange fashionable phases. Next time they nag you about your hair or your clothes, ask to see their high school photo albums and see how fast the story changes. You may just find you have more in common than you thought.

                                    For superfans, there's nothing better than an unfolding storyline. Marshmello gets it, and the masked music maker has given us plenty of looks into his candy-coated world. We’ve seen him make his way through high school, playing talent shows and walking the stage at graduation. We even saw him putting in work pre-fame at a boring office job -- but what was that office job all about? It's all explained via the "Power" music video.

                                  Remember that time Marshmello made a music video about a little girl and the dog that got her through life's toughest moments? Remember how the dog eventually died in the end and it turned you into a sniveling wretch? Well, the masked music maker is back with another tune for your heart-strings, this time with the music video for his Chvrches collaboration "Here With Me."

For the April 3 episode of Jimmy Kimmel Live! in Las Vegas, he busted out the old electric guitar for a live performance alongside Scottish indie pop band Chvrches of their hit "Here With Me."                                </div>

                                        The best episodes are cartoons are the ones where you favorite characters cross over into each other's worlds. Likewise, the most fun fictional universes are the ones wherein different characters exist within the same world and sometimes come together in surprising ways. So it goes with Marshmello's "Tell Me" music video, the plot of which centers around a high school talent show, and who takes turns on stage but all of Marshmello's musical friends.                                    </div>
